    <p>This diagram is intended to illustrate the land use condition and the ownership of the properties in Harlem. To be specific, I want display the similarities and differences among these three neighborhoods to help potential developers make right decision.</p>
    <p>I chose Mekko chart to show the different compositions of land use in the three neighborhoods of Harlem. The color of the rectangle stands for the type of land use. The height of rectangle stands for the percentage of this kind of use of its own neighborhood. The width of the rectangle stands for the total count of the buildings in the neighborhood. Each type of land use is given to one color.</p>
    <p>This Mekko chart makes it easy to compare the number of total buildings in three neighborhoods as well as the composition of land use inside and outside the neighborhood.</p>

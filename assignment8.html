      <h4>Data Visulization Critique of Scaled in Miles</h4>
    <br>
    <p>On April 24, 1945, 17-year old trumpet player Miles Dewey Davis got the chance to play with famous saxophonist Charlie Parker. In the following decades, Miles explored new musical territory and redefined the scope of jazz time after time [1]. Just as Miles Davis said in his autobiography, in his whole lifetime he was happy to put talented musicians together to create moving music.</p>
    <p>This data visualization piece displays the history of Miles Davis' career and collaborations based on his recording sessions as documented by the Jazz Discography Project [2]. The visualization tries to represent the broad cooperation between Miles and other talented musicians in different events through his lifetime. The cooperation took place in New York City most frequently but also reach to other states of the US and extent to many European countries. Miles’ great achievement and influence in jazz territory can be visibly learned from this visualization piece.</p>

    <h2>What has been shown?</h2>
    <p>The timeline across the middle of the visualization piece includes more than four hundred recording sessions. Each recording session is represented by an erect short line. As all the recording sessions are arranged in the order of performing time from the left to the right, the aggregation of the lines represent high frequency of Miles’ performance. For every single event, date, place, musicians playing with Miles and their roles are noted in the screen.</p>
    <p>The moveable circles above the lines represent the nearly six hundred people who played with Miles and larger circles means more cooperation with Miles [1]. For every single musician, his role and the different performing events are noted.</p>
    <p>On the bottom of the screen, jazz piece played at that time will appear as the event changes.</p>
    <p>In general, the visualization clearly displays the recording sessions played by Miles and musicians he gathered in chronological order. These musicians are related to Miles by cooperative performances. People can feel Miles’ strength of gathering and creating. However, all the recording sessions are shown without difference. Miles’ remarkable sessions or performances are not visible from the visualization. Besides, musicians with significant relation with Miles have not been pointed out except for the cooperation frequency. People cannot touch the interesting stories behind the recording sessions.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>How the data is treated?</h2>
  <div align="center">
    <img src="img/data.jpg">
  </div>
    <br>
    <p>The dataset of this visualization piece is Jazz Discography Project including all the recording sessions of Miles through his lifetime as well as the musicians and performing data and places. The picture above just shows a single record of the discography.</p>
    <p>Edward Tufte stated in his article “Graphical Integrity” that compared to tables the special power of graphics is to display larger data sets [3]. And in Lev Manovich’s “What is Data Visualization”, he said that the first principle of visualization is reduction. In his words, “We throw away 99% of what is specific about each object to represent only 1%” [4]. For this part, the author of this visualization piece successfully transferred massive text information into visible symbols and concise words. Besides, Manovich also pointed out that the goal of visualization if to discover the structure of a dataset. The author of this visualization piece respects the chronological order of the discography and adds into his understanding of Miles’ ability to gather talented people to create incredible music and then let them go [5]. From this aspect, the piece is successful in revealing the original structure of the data.</p>
    <p>For the consideration of chronology, not only the sessions are arranged by date but the aggregation extent is shown by the short lines. As for the interaction with musicians, not only people’s name and role are listed in each event but the cooperation frequency is represented by the size of the circles. The information was collected and analyzed by the author whose expression far enhanced the readability of the original data.</p>
    <p>As for the implication of this visualization about one notable jazz player’s career in 20th century, we can kind of figure out the prosperity of jazz in New York City as most of his performance took place there. Miles’ broad network in jazz field can also be easily seen from these over 600 musicians ever played with him. We can feel the power of jazz and jazz player to collect players as well as audiences in last century.</p>

    <h2>Layout and interactivity</h2>
    <h3>Layout</h3>
    <p>Manovich stated the importance of space arrangement(layout) in his article “Visualization Methods for Media Studies”. He thinks that the meaning and emotional impacts of an image depends most of all the spatial arrangements(layout) of its parts. The layout includes the distance between elements and their positions, shape, sizes and other spatial variables code quantitative differences between objects and their relations [6]. In my stand of point, the visualization tries to emphasize two concepts: the rich recording sessions of Miles in his whole life and his broad interception with other musicians. These two concepts are conveyed effectively from the arrangement and layout of the symbols.</p>
    <p>Timeline is the storyline which links all the recording sessions and performers. Joanna Drucker pointed out in her “Humanities Approaches to Graphical Display” that there are two conceptions of time. Some people consider time as an existing container within which events occur and others consider time as an effect of occurrences in temporal relation to each other [7]. Here the timeline combines both concepts. It accommodates all the events as a container and makes the expression of the information very coherent and rational. And each short line is just an effect of each occurrence. Comparing the extremely thin erect short line to the stretched life-long timeline, the richness of Miles’ work and performance can be seen.</p>
    <p>Another concept is about the gathering and separating of people with great talent and passion in jazz. Miles Davis, as the leading character of the story, collect performers with different instruments from different places into the same room. After their cooperative creation and performance, they separated again forward different directions. The “sea” of circles above the line represents these talented musicians who scatter across the world.</p>

    <h3>Interactivity</h3>
    <p>Most information about the recording sessions and relative performers is concealed behind the symbols in this visualization. By clicking or putting the mouse over the symbols concrete information about the event or the performer will appear.</p>
    <p>Click over the timeline to highlight the people who played with Miles on each date or click over the arrow on the right side to switch one by one. Move the mouse over single circle to see the specific artist it represents and highlight their sessions by clicking on the circles. You can also find people and recording session directly in the search box.</p>
    <p>One thing to point is the moving of the circles which reflects the gathering and separating of performers. For each switch of the highlighted event in the middle of the screen, circles representing performers who participated the event move downward from the “sea” of circles and irrelevant persons go back to their original positions. This motion of people just mirrors the flow of folk jazz musicians and their great insistence to preserve and spread this blue music to more places.</p>
    <p>And if your browser plays audio, you can listen to samples from iTunes in the upper left. With the blue keynote of the visualization and soothing music ringing, the concepts of this piece are well expressed.</p>
    <br>
    <p>In conclusion, this visualization piece successfully displays the career of Miles Davis and his intersection with other talented performers in 45 years by his works and performances. Viewers can feel the concepts of gathering, creating and separating the author conveyed. However, the boundary of this visualization piece is that the particular importance of some musicians and recording sessions have not been included in. When only showing the 1% character of all the objects, some specific information may be filtered in neglect.</p>
